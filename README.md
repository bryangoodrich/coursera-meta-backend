# coursera-meta-backend-littlelemon

A repo for my Coursera Meta Back-End Developer certification course work and codespace.

## API

The API folder contains the final project for the APIs course. It was a considerable challenge compared to everything else in this program, but in the end it can be seen as pretty simple once you fully appreciate all the components. Unfortuntely, I think they did not prepare us for all the content used in even their final result. 


### The Full Stack

The Fullstack folder contains the final project template we built from to design the Booking API.
