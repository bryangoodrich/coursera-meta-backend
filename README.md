# coursera-meta-backend-littlelemon

A repo for my Coursera Meta Back-End Developer certification course work and codespace.

## Capstone Course

For the Capstone share, clone this repo and navigate to the Capstone folder. There you can `pipenv shell` and `pipenv install` or `pipenv update` to ensure the dependencies are satisfied in your virtual environment. Then see the README for details on the grading. 

## API

The API folder contains the final project for the APIs course. It was a considerable challenge compared to everything else in this program, but in the end it can be seen as pretty simple once you fully appreciate all the components. Unfortuntely, I think they did not prepare us for all the content used in even their final result. 


### The Full Stack

The Fullstack folder contains the final project template we built from to design the Booking API.
